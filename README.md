# ELT-Docker-Jupyter-Notebook-Environment

This project demonstrates how to build an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline using **Docker** to perform AdaBoost classification. 
The goal is to show how we can manage data engineering and machine learning workflows inside a containerized environment, 
making it easy for colleagues or collaborators to run your work without needing Anaconda or any complex setups on their local machines.

## Project Overview
This project consists of:
- A **Dockerfile** to containerize the environment.
- A **requirements.txt** file to list the required Python dependencies.Libraries listed here are: numpy, pandas and scikit-learn
- A **Jupyter notebook** that implements an AdaBoost classifier for data classification.
